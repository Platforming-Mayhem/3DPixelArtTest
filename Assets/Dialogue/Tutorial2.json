You’re the new editor after all? I’m sure there are a myriad of things to report on.","\n","^MC: So how am I supposed to get that working?","\n","^Erik: Just type up any stories you might have for a publicationa and the system should just take care of it on its own. It’ll sort it by category, once you select one it should hopefully bring whatever stories you can use. Once you find a story just drag it onto the scriptwriter. Once it’s full, you’re good to publish it.","\n","^MC: Alright, sounds easy enough, thanks Erik.","\n","^Erik: No problem, newbie.
