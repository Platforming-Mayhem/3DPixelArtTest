Healing[On Phone]: I’m telling you bro, one piece is the new ting! It’s all about yano, did you see when Luffy used Snakeman? That was hard.

Zoro: Uh huh, what do you think of the green haired guy?

Healing: Zoro? He’s cold but luffy and sanji are better, I be real.

Zoro: Even with 3 swords?


Healing: Luffy solos zoro easily.
