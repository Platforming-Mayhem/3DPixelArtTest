  title: Healthcare sector sees massive workforce increase
  blurb: "With the toll of the war ever increasing, the healthcare sector has seen
    an all time high, albeit expected, of staff as well as profits. We\u2019ve always
    prided ourselves on our top of the line medical equipment and research so clearly
    this development is another result in the stead of this. As a quick little related
    side note, unemployment has dropped by 9% so what sector do you think was the
    greatest contributor to this?"
