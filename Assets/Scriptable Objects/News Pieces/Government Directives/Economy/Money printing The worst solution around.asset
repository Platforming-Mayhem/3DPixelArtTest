  title: Money printing? The worst solution around?
  blurb: 'Damn. No really, just damn. The solution the minds of this wonderful country
    come up with to cover our declining economy? Money printing. Not just a tiny
    bit. Not a large amount. But apparently, prices have nearly shot up 250%. What
    kind of ridiculous times are we living in to have people with these ideas? You
    tell me. '
