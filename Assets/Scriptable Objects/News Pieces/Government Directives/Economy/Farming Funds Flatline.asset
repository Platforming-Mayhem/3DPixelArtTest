  title: Farming Funds Flatline
  blurb: "For those of you in the agriculture field, I\u2019m afraid the next few
    months are going to be quite rough for you. Imports ranging from wine all the
    way to red meat have decided to take a nosedive. The world economy is changing
    and it seems for us, not for the better."
