  title: Energy pulsates round the country for 30% less!
  blurb: "Sorry for the miniature ad, but what a time to be alive. The magicians
    in power have somehow reduced energy prices AGAIN. Please, enlighten me on how
    this country isn\u2019t great? With most of the country already having to worry
    about wages, a 30% reduction in energy prices isn\u2019t something to just smile
    for, this is something to scream about. I for one, will be beaming heading home
    knowing I\u2019ll get to be saving a good amount of money."
