  title: Lebiasto illegal cache seized!
  blurb: Our glorious soldiers out in the frontline have managed to finally find
    an illegal cache filled with all sorts of prohibited weapons ranging from chemical
    weapons to flamethrowers and hollow points. This seems to be a major turning
    point currently, with talks of the Sergu Alliance joining the war effort as an
    investigative as well as possibly military power.
