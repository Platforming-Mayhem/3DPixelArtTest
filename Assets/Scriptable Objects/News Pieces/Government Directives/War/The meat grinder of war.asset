  title: The meat grinder of war
  blurb: "10,000. 20,000. 30,000. 40,000. 50,000. It keeps going higher. Then some
    higher again. Then some more. All the way until it consumes us all. Guess what
    figure this represents. Not general casualties no, something much smaller. This
    isn\u2019t enemy ground casualties. I\u2019ll go ahead and tell you. This is
    the amount of U-21\u2019s we\u2019ve had to bury and say goodbye to in the last
    6 months. What kind of war are we truly fighting to excuse the amount laid to
    rest for it?"
