  title: 10 Dead in suspicous bombing of civilian resident block
  blurb: "With the outcry reaching even us here in the ever dense metal jungles of
    Dency. 10 civilians who\u2019ve tried to the live their lives in peace, as peaceful
    as it gets during these dangerous time, have had their time cut short due to
    a shrapnel bomb hitting a resident block. According to multiple experts, there
    should have been no reason to hit anywhere close to the block with there being
    no form of military base in the area. With the people of Lebiasto in traumatic
    shock once more, we went to ask the Minister for War on their opinion on the
    matter. We haven\u2019t had a response back since. "
