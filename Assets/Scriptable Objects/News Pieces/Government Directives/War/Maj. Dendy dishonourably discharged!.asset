  title: Maj. Dendy dishonourably discharged?!
  blurb: 'Just last night, we got a tip off with a LT. allegedly claiming, the Maj.
    for the Special Division was dishonourably discharged after a Court Martial had
    just finished. Furthermore to this out of this world allegation, they said that
    it was due to the following offences: Bribery, Nepotism as well as Negligence.
    The court had no issues with performance as well as conduct however, all these
    high profile cases of corruption seem to be piling up on the government. What
    else can there possibly be?'
