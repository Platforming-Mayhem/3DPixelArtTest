  title: Civilian Casualty Catastrophe
  blurb: "What\u2019s going on? There\u2019s been a reported 5000 civilian deaths
    these past 2 months, a ridiculous 20/80 split between all reported combatant
    deaths. Drone strikes are a key player in these absolutely abhorrent acts, often
    striking the civilian population in the guise of striking \u201Ckey targets\u201D.
    With the war seeing no sign of resolution, how much higher will that number go?"
