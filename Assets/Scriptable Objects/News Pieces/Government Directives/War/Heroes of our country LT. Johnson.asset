  title: 'Heroes of our country: LT. Johnson'
  blurb: "LT. Johnson. An icon of our country that unfortunately isn\u2019t recognised
    by many. The recently retired army LT. has done everything in his power to serve
    this country and he has a flaming passion. Commanding the youth of our country
    while sustaining them is no small feat in modern times. LT. Johnson has been
    in nearly every war from the last 20 years alone making him a quadruple tour
    serviceman. Look up to him and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll go to the right places."
