  title: Sergu Alliance to mediate peace talks
  blurb: The spokesman for the Sergu Alliance has stated that peace talks between
    Lebiasto and Dency are to start in the next coming week, with the Sergu Alliance
    acting as a mediator. This comes as a shock to many experts and civilians alike,
    as there's been no sign of the Dency front slowing down nor the Lebiasto Defensive
    faltering from their duties. Many claim these will come to nothing and only justify
    further war efforts. Whilst a small few, claim to hope for a meaningful resolution
    to this senseless conflict.
