  title: Scuffle in a bar over nationality??
  blurb: It seems an asylum seeker, Reina, alongside a local resident, Dilan, have
    gotten into a heated argument, unfortunately leading to Reina being hospitalised.
    This started due to Reina begging for money whilst waiting for a response from
    the government on her refugee status application. From there Dilan publicly shamed
    and mocked her to the point that different sources claim how it started but what
    we can confirm is that it ended with a brawl.
