  title: Refugees or victims?
  blurb: "We\u2019ve created nearly 20,000 refugees within the last few months alone.
    We\u2019re supposedly the \u201Cheroes\u201D of this narrative; we're spoon fed
    on a daily basis. But how come we\u2019re only bringing suffering to others.
    Good? What good have we put into the world currently? What else will this war
    take from people?"
